# Pending Feedback Log

## CRITICAL - App Issues
- [ ] **App not functioning** - User reports app doesn't work. Need error details.

## NEW - Jan 30 (Today)
- [x] **Strong beat collisions** - REMOVED from codebase (analysis.js, App.jsx, docs)

## VISUALIZATION ISSUES (from earlier conversation)
- [ ] **Areas in viz** - Continued issues with area calculations
- [ ] **Non-stretto viz less intuitive** - Color scheme inconsistency
- [ ] **Unified view** - Created UnifiedCounterpointViz but may need refinement

## SCORING ISSUES (Status Unknown - need user confirmation)
- [ ] Stretto: Use top 3 distances, not percentage of viable
- [ ] Rhythmic variety: Account for rests/syncopation creating variety
- [ ] Double-counting in invertibility parallel perfects
- [ ] Sequences: User asked "doesn't seem to be linked to scoring" - IS linked (75% penalty reduction)

## OLDER COMMENTS (Jan 27) - Likely Addressed
These were from the initial review. User to confirm if still issues:
- Voice independence 4:1 ratio (contrary+oblique vs similar+parallel)
- Consecutive perfects: 2 allowed, penalty from 3rd
- Consecutive 3rds/6ths: 3 allowed, penalty from 4th
- Accented passing/neighbor tones: -0.5 not -1.0
- Inversion equivalence: P4 up ≠ P5 up for sequences

## FOR LATER
- [ ] Second countersubject support (CS2)
- [ ] Harmonic scoring integration (started, may need more)
