# Definitions Reference

All terms used in the Fugue Subject Analyzer, cross-referenced to code.

---

## Fugal Terms

### Subject
The primary melodic theme of a fugue. Each voice presents it in turn. Entered via the Subject ABC input field.

**Code**: Parsed by `abcParser.js:parseABC()` into `NoteEvent[]`. Stored as `subjectInput` / `subjectNotes` in `App.jsx`.

### Countersubject (CS)
A secondary melody that consistently accompanies subject entries. Must work against both subject (tonic) and answer (dominant), and should be invertible.

**Code**: Parsed identically to subject. Stored as `csInput` / `csNotes` in `App.jsx`.

### Answer
The subject transposed to the dominant (up a perfect fifth). Two types:

- **Real answer**: Exact interval-for-interval transposition.
- **Tonal answer**: Modified transposition when the subject emphasizes ^1-^5 or ^5-^1 motion. The adjustment preserves tonic-dominant polarity.

**Mutation point**: Where real transposition resumes after the tonal adjustment.

**Code**: Generated by `analysis.js:testTonalAnswer()`. Stored as `answerInput` / `answerNotes` in `App.jsx`.

### Stretto
Overlapping entries where a new voice begins the subject before the previous voice finishes. Each possible entry distance is tested as full two-voice counterpoint at multiple transposition intervals.

**Transpositions tested**: All unique interval classes from [0, 12, -12, 7, -7, 5, -5, 19, -19, 17, -17, 24, -24], deduplicated by mod 12 equivalence (octave-equivalent transpositions produce identical interval patterns). This yields 3 unique classes: unison (0), P4 (5), P5 (7).

**Code**: `analysis.js:testStrettoViability()`. Tests all (transposition, distance) combinations. Each receives full dissonance analysis.

### Dux / Comes
In stretto and canon contexts: **dux** = the leading voice (first entry), **comes** = the following voice (delayed entry).

**Code**: Used in `StrettoViz.jsx` and stretto analysis. `duxPitch` / `comesPitch` in interval point objects.

### Double Counterpoint (Invertibility)
The ability to swap voice positions — the upper voice becomes the lower and vice versa. "At the octave" means one voice is displaced by an octave.

**Code**: `analysis.js:testDoubleCounterpoint()`. Tests original configuration (CS above) and inverted (CS below, transposed down an octave).

### Junction
The harmonic progression implied when the subject's final note connects to the answer's entry on the dominant.

| Terminal Degree | Junction | Quality |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| ^1 | I-V | Strong |
| ^7 | vii-V | Strong |
| ^4 | IV-V | Strong |
| ^2 | ii-V | Good |
| ^3 | I-V | Good |
| ^5 | V-V | Static (problematic) |
| Other | ?-V | Unusual (problematic) |

**Code**: Evaluated in `scoring.js:scoreTonalClarity()`.

### Sequence (Melodic)
A pattern that repeats at consecutive transposition levels — not scattered motivic recurrences. Example: a 3-note figure immediately repeated a step lower, then another step lower.

Detection requires:
- Consecutive repetitions (adjacent in time)
- Interval class matching (M3/m3 treated as same "3rd" class)
- Rhythm matching (within 10% tolerance)
- Inversion equivalence (P4 up = P5 down)

**Code**: `analysis.js:detectSequences()`. Sequence ranges stored and passed to dissonance scoring for penalty mitigation.

## Data Structures

### NoteEvent
A single parsed note with timing and pitch information.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `pitch` | number | MIDI pitch (60 = C4, middle C) |
| `duration` | number | In quarter-note units (0.5 = eighth note) |
| `onset` | number | Beat position, 0-indexed, in quarter-note units |
| `scaleDegree` | ScaleDegree | Scale degree in the analysis key (^1, ^#4, etc.) |
| `abcNote` | string | Original ABC notation text |

**Code**: `types/music.js:NoteEvent`

### ScaleDegree
A scale degree with optional chromatic alteration.

| Field | Type | Values |
|-------|------|--------|
| `degree` | number | 1-7 |
| `alteration` | number | -1 (flat), 0 (natural), +1 (sharp) |

Display: `^1`, `^#4`, `^b7`, etc.

**Code**: `types/music.js:ScaleDegree`

### Interval
A vertical interval between two simultaneous pitches, reduced to within one octave.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `semitones` | number | 0-11 (mod 12) |
| `class` | number | 1-8 (unison through octave) |
| `quality` | string | `perfect`, `major`, `minor`, `augmented`, `diminished` |

| Semitones | Class | Quality | Consonant? |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 0 | 1 (unison) | perfect | Yes |
| 1 | 2 | minor | No |
| 2 | 2 | major | No |
| 3 | 3 | minor | Yes |
| 4 | 3 | major | Yes |
| 5 | 4 | perfect | Context-dependent* |
| 6 | 4 | augmented | No (tritone) |
| 7 | 5 | perfect | Yes |
| 8 | 6 | minor | Yes |
| 9 | 6 | major | Yes |
| 10 | 7 | minor | No |
| 11 | 7 | major | No |

*P4 is always treated as dissonant in two-voice counterpoint (one voice is always the bass). The user can override this via the P4 checkbox.

**Code**: `types/music.js:Interval`. Consonance check: `Interval.isConsonant()` — returns true for classes 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 (excluding augmented/diminished qualities).

### Simultaneity
A moment when two notes from different voices overlap in time.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `onset` | number | Beat position (quarter-note units) |
| `voice1Note` | NoteEvent | Upper voice note |
| `voice2Note` | NoteEvent | Lower voice note |
| `interval` | Interval | Vertical interval between the voices |
| `metricWeight` | number | 0-1, from `metricWeight()` |

**Code**: `types/music.js:Simultaneity`. Created by `analysis.js:findSimultaneities()`.

### MelodicMotion
Motion between consecutive notes in a single voice.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `time` | number | When the motion occurs |
| `semitones` | number | Absolute interval size |
| `direction` | number | +1 (up), -1 (down), 0 (unison) |

**Code**: `types/music.js:MelodicMotion`

---

## Internal Timing System

All timing uses **quarter-note units** (internal units):

| Duration | Internal Units |
|----------|---------------|
| Whole note | 4.0 |
| Dotted half | 3.0 |
| Half note | 2.0 |
| Dotted quarter | 1.5 |
| Quarter note | 1.0 |
| Eighth note | 0.5 |
| Sixteenth note | 0.25 |

Measures in internal units:
- 4/4: 4 units per measure (4 quarter-note beats)
- 3/4: 3 units per measure
- 6/8: 3 units per measure (2 dotted-quarter beats of 1.5 units each)
- 9/8: 4.5 units per measure (3 dotted-quarter beats)
- 12/8: 6 units per measure (4 dotted-quarter beats)
- 2/2: 4 units per measure (2 half-note beats of 2 units each)

**Code**: `formatter.js` header comment, `BeatFormatter` constructor.

### Time Position Format

`M{measure}.B{beat}.{subdivision}.{fraction}`

- M = measure number (1-indexed)
- B = beat number within measure (1-indexed)
- Subdivision = which subdivision of the beat (1-indexed)
- Fraction = position within subdivision (0-9, where 5 = midpoint)

Examples:
- `M1.B1` — downbeat of measure 1
- `M3.B3.2` — second subdivision of beat 3, measure 3
- `M3.B3.3.5` — midpoint of the 3rd eighth of beat 3, measure 3

**Code**: `formatter.js:BeatFormatter.formatBeat()`

---

## Metric System

### Compound vs Simple Meter

**Simple meters**: Beat divides in 2 (2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 2/2, 3/2, 6/4).
**Compound meters**: Beat divides in 3 (6/8, 9/8, 12/8). Detected when numerator is divisible by 3, denominator is 8, and numerator >= 6.

Note: 3/8 is treated as simple (1 beat per measure), not compound.

**Code**: `formatter.js:BeatFormatter.isCompound`, `metricWeight()`.

### Metric Weight

A 0-1 value indicating the strength of a beat position. Used throughout the scoring system to determine how severely issues are penalized.

| Weight | Label | Severity | Description |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1.0 | Downbeat | Strong | Beat 1 of any measure |
| 0.75 | Secondary accent | Moderate | Beat 3 in 4/4; beat 3 in 12/8 |
| 0.5 | Weak beat | Mild | Other main beats (beats 2, 4 in 4/4) |
| 0.35 | Subdivision | Light | Off-beat primary subdivision (e.g., eighth notes in 4/4) |
| 0.25 | Sub-subdivision | Light | Sixteenth-note level |
| 0.2 | Off-beat | Negligible | Other subdivisions |

Compound meter subdivisions (2nd and 3rd eighth within a dotted-quarter beat): 0.3.

**Code**: `formatter.js:metricWeight(onset, meter)`, `metricPosition()`, `metricSeverity()`.

### "On the beat"
Means the attack occurs at the beat onset (the very start of the beat), not just anywhere during the beat.

### Strong Beat (in dissonance scoring)
`metricWeight(onset) >= 0.75`. This means beat 1 and beat 3 in 4/4, or beat 1 and beat 3 in 12/8.

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:isStrongBeat()` — checks `metricWeight(onset, currentMeter) >= 0.75`.

---

## Motion Types

How two voices move relative to each other between consecutive simultaneities.

| Type | Definition | Scoring Impact |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Contrary** | Voices move in opposite directions | Entry: +0.5 |
| **Oblique** | One voice moves, the other holds | Entry: +0.5 |
| **Similar** | Both move same direction, different intervals | Entry: -0.5 to -1.0 |
| **Parallel** | Both move same direction and same interval | Entry: -1.5 |
| **Static** | Neither voice moves | Neutral |
| **Reentry** | After a rest > 1 quarter AND > 2x last note duration | Always neutral (0) |

**From rest modifier**: When a voice enters from a rest, similar/parallel penalties are halved (asynchronous motion is less audible).

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:getMotionType()` (lines 309-358).

---

## Interval Magnitude Classification

How melodic intervals (within a single voice) are categorized by size.

| Type | Semitones | Examples |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Unison | 0 | Repeated note |
| Step | 1-2 | m2, M2 |
| Skip | 3-4 | m3, M3 |
| Perfect leap | 5 or 7 | P4, P5 |
| Octave | 12 | P8 |
| Large leap | 6, 8-11, 13+ | TT, m6, M6, m7, M7, compound |

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:getIntervalMagnitude()` (lines 189-197).

---

## Short Note

A note whose duration is below the sub-subdivision threshold (subdivision / 3). Short notes receive reduced penalties:

- Consecutive dissonance penalty: halved if on off-beat
- Motion/parallel penalties: halved if the interval is NOT repeated
- Repetition penalties: halved

Thresholds by meter:
- 4/4: subdivision = 0.5 (eighth), threshold ~ 0.167 (triplet eighth)
- 6/8: subdivision = 0.333, threshold ~ 0.111

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:getShortNoteInfo()`, `getShortNoteThreshold()`.

---

## Dissonance Treatment Patterns

Each dissonance is evaluated in three phases: **Entry** (C -> D), **Dissonance** (type/position), **Exit** (D -> C or D -> D).

### Suspension / Retardation
Oblique entry on a strong beat, step resolution by the held voice. Suspension resolves downward; retardation resolves upward.

- Entry bonus: +0.75 (oblique preparation)
- Exit bonus: +0.5 (step resolution) + 0.25 if downward
- Total: +1.25 to +1.5

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:checkPatterns()` lines 791-826.

### Appoggiatura
Leap or skip entry on a strong beat, step resolution in the opposite direction.

- Entry bonus: +2.0 (offsets leap penalty)
- Exit bonus: +0.5
- Total: +2.5

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:checkPatterns()` lines 850-898.

### Cambiata (Nota Cambiata)
Step entry followed by a skip of a 3rd in the same direction.

| Variant | Label | Beat | Entry Bonus | Exit Bonus | Total |
|---------|-------|------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Traditional (descending) | Cam | Weak | +0.3 | +1.2 | +1.5 |
| Inverted (ascending) | Cam^ | Weak | +0.2 | +0.8 | +1.0 |
| Strong beat (descending) | Cam? | Strong | +0.1 | +0.4 | +0.5 |
| Strong beat (inverted) | Cam^? | Strong | +0.1 | +0.4 | +0.5 |

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:checkPatterns()` lines 901-999.

### Escape Tone (Echappee)
Step entry, skip or leap exit in the opposite direction.

- Bonus: +0.5

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:checkPatterns()` lines 1002-1026.

### Passing Tone (PT)
Stepwise through in the same direction on a weak beat.

- Bonus: 0 (no penalty, no reward — this is baseline acceptable)

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:checkPatterns()` lines 1028-1047.

### Neighbor Tone (N)
Step out and step back (opposite direction) on a weak beat.

- Bonus: 0 (baseline acceptable)

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:checkPatterns()` lines 1049-1068.

### Anticipation (Ant)
Oblique entry on a weak beat — one voice arrives early. Non-parallel exit.

- Bonus: +0.5

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:checkPatterns()` lines 828-848.

### Unprepared Dissonance
A strong-beat dissonance not matching any recognized pattern. Scores poorly due to no pattern bonus to offset the strong-beat penalty.

---

## Resolution

### Resolution to consonance
When a dissonance (D) moves to a consonance (C):
- To imperfect consonance (3rd, 6th): +1.0
- To perfect consonance (unison, P5, P8): +0.5

### Resolution to dissonance (D -> D)
When a dissonance leads to another dissonance:
- Normal: -0.75
- Short note on off-beat: -0.375 (halved)

### Resolution by abandonment
One voice drops out (rests) leaving the dissonance unresolved: -0.5.

### Phantom note
A note conceptually extends for `duration / 2` beats into a following rest. If the rest exceeds this phantom duration, the resolution is considered delayed (-0.3).

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:scoreExit()` (lines 568-760).

---

## Parallel Fifths and Octaves

Two consecutive simultaneities where both are P5 (or both P1/P8) and both voices move in the same direction. A critical voice-leading error in all contexts.

Detection: Both voices must actually move (not just one). Direction of both voices must match.

**Code**: `vizConstants.js:isParallelFifthOrOctave()`. Also checked in stretto, invertibility, and modulatory robustness analyses.

---

## Sequence Mitigation

When a dissonance occurs within a detected melodic sequence, leap penalties are reduced by 75% (`penalty *= 0.25`). Sequences create their own structural logic that justifies intervals that would otherwise be problematic.

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js:scoreExit()` — checks `isOnsetInSequence()`. Multiplier defined in `constants.js:ANALYSIS_THRESHOLDS.SEQUENCE_PENALTY_MULT`.

---

## Score Categories

### Base-Zero System
- **0** = Acceptable baseline (neutral, unremarkable)
- **Positive** = Strengths (higher = better)
- **Negative** = Weaknesses (lower = more problematic)

Overall score = weighted average of active categories.

### Categories

| # | Category | UI Label | Weight | Group | Code Function |
|---|----------|----------|--------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Tonal Clarity | Tonal Definition | 0.5 | Melodic | `scoring.js:scoreTonalClarity()` |
| 2 | Rhythmic Character | Rhythmic Character | 0.8 | Melodic | `scoring.js:scoreRhythmicCharacter()` |
| 3 | Stretto Potential | Stretto Potential | 1.0 | Fugal | `scoring.js:scoreStrettoPotential()` |
| 4 | Answer Compatibility | Answer Compatibility | 0.9 | Fugal | Part of tonal answer scoring |
| 5 | Invertibility | Invertibility | 1.0 | Combination | `scoring.js:scoreInvertibility()` |
| 6 | Rhythmic Interplay | Rhythmic Interplay | 0.8 | Combination | `scoring.js:scoreRhythmicInterplay()` |
| 7 | Voice Independence | Voice Independence | 0.9 | Combination | `scoring.js:scoreVoiceIndependence()` |
| 8 | Transposition Stability | Answer vs CS | 1.0 | Combination | `scoring.js:scoreTranspositionStability()` |

- Without countersubject: categories 1-4 only (Melodic + Fugal groups)
- With countersubject: all 8 categories

**Code**: `scoring.js:calculateOverallScore()`.

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Rating | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| >= 15 | Strong | Notably strong fugue material |
| 5 to 14 | Good | Good fugue material |
| 0 to 4 | Fair | Acceptable, unremarkable |
| < 0 | Weak | Below acceptable baseline |

### Stretto Scoring Formula

The stretto score has five components, computed across all (transposition, distance) combinations:

| Component | Formula | Cap |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| (i) Viable count | min(10, viableCount - 2) | 10 |
| (ii)a Transposition diversity | min((viableIntervals - 1.5) * 2, 8) | 8 |
| (ii)b Distance diversity | min((viableDistances - 0.25 * totalDistances) * 2, 8) | 8 |
| (iii) Top-5 quality | avg dissonance score of top 5 diverse strettos, scaled x4 | unbounded |
| (iv) Close stretto | +5 if 75%+, +3 if 60%+, -3 if no 40%+, -5 if no 30%+ | ±5 |
| (v) Viable gap | (furthest - closest - 0.25 * subjectLength) * 4, clamped | ±10 |

"Top 5 diverse" = best-scoring strettos with no distance or transposition interval repeated more than once.

**Code**: `scoring.js:calculateStrettoPotentialScore()`.

## Consonance Context Rules

### Consecutive Perfect Intervals
3+ consecutive perfect intervals (unison, P5, P8): -0.5 per extra beyond 2.

### Consecutive Imperfect Consonances
4+ consecutive 3rds: -0.25 per extra beyond 3.
4+ consecutive 6ths: -0.25 per extra beyond 3.

**Code**: `dissonanceScoring.js` consonance context scoring.

---

## ABC Notation (Input Format)

### Pitch
- `C D E F G A B` = octave below middle C to B
- `c d e f g a b` = middle C octave
- `'` = up one octave, `,` = down one octave

### Accidentals (prefix the note)
- `^` = sharp, `_` = flat, `=` = natural

### Duration (suffix the note, multiplies default note length)
- `2` = double, `3` = triple, `/2` = half, `3/2` = 1.5x

### Headers
- `K:D` = D major, `K:Dm` = D minor
- `L:1/8` = default note length is eighth note
- `M:3/4` = time signature

### Spelling Key vs Analysis Key
The spelling key determines how ABC accidentals are parsed. The analysis key determines scale degree interpretation. These can differ — e.g., spell in C major (explicit accidentals) but analyze as D minor.

**Code**: `abcParser.js:parseABC()`, `constants.js:KEY_SIGNATURES`.
